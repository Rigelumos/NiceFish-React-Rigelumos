NiceFish (Áæé‰∫∫È±º) is a series of projects aimed at demonstrating the development and deployment of a frontend-backend separation pattern. There are three frontend versions: browser environment, mobile environment, and Electron environment; and two backend versions: SpringBoot version and SpringCloud version.

## 1. Introduction

This is the React version of the NiceFish frontend interface. This project is developed using pure JSX, without TypeScript. NiceFish also provides a backend server interface implementation based on SpringBoot, see: https://gitee.com/mumu-osc/nicefish-spring-boot.

**Note: To prevent potential NodeJS module compatibility issues, this project locks all Node module versions in the package.json file. If necessary, you can test compatible version numbers on your own (though this is not recommended, as it may consume a significant amount of time).**

## 3. Usage

Open your command line terminal and execute the following commands:

```
   git clone https://gitee.com/mumu-osc/NiceFish-React.git
   cd NiceFish-React
   npm i
   npm start
```

**üöÄüöÄüöÄ For Chinese developers**: Due to network constraints, it is recommended to install nrm to manage the npm registry.

    npm i -g nrm
    nrm use taobao

By doing so, npm will use the registry provided by taobao when installing node modules.

## 4. Switching Between Mock and Backend Versions

For the sake of facilitating frontend-backend separation development, this project offers two startup modes:

- Startup mode with mock data: npm run start:dev-mock (or directly npm start, which defaults to mock mode). All mock data is located in the src/mock-data directory, in JSON format, consistent with the format of data returned by the backend API (**please refrain from moving these files' paths; NiceFish has implemented custom middleware that enables webpack devServer to load these files in development mode, with the code residing in /config/webpack.dev.js**).
- Startup mode to access real backend API: npm run start:dev-backend (using this mode requires a functional backend server; NiceFish provides an implementation of a backend server interface based on SpringBoot, refer to: https://gitee.com/mumu-osc/nicefish-spring-boot.)

Configuration items related to the startup environment can be found in environment.\* and webpack.common.js files.

## 5. Unit Testing

```
   yarn test or npm run test
```

## 6. End-to-End Testing

```
   yarn cypress:open or  npm run cypress:open
   yarn cypress:run or  npm run cypress:run
```
